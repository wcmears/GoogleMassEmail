# GoogleMassEmail
Written to take a google sheet with a list of emails and peoples names, along with a google doc with a message to be sent to all of those people, and mail merge/send emails. Most of the code in this repo is a combination of https://github.com/googleworkspace/python-samples/tree/main/docs/mail-merge and https://github.com/googleworkspace/python-samples/tree/main/gmail/snippet/send%20mail. I simply combined the two and generalized things to make it easy for anyone that wants to send mass emails. Here are a sample sheet and a sample doc to try with this code:
